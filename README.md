# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe in Python
This project utilizes the MediaPipe library in Python to perform hand gesture recognition. The system is designed to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time using a webcam feed. It can be used for various applications such as controlling computer interfaces, gaming, and sign language translation.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can install them using pip:
bash

## Usage
To run the hand gesture recognition system, navigate to the final_model directory and execute the main.py script:

bash
Copy code
```
cd final_model
python main.py
```
This will start the webcam feed and display the real-time hand gesture recognition results.

## Supported Gestures
Currently, the system supports recognition of the following hand gestures:

OK
Bye
Hello
Thanks
I Love You
Sorry
Customization
You can customize the hand gesture recognition system by modifying the parameters in the config.py file. This file contains configurations such as camera resolution, model accuracy, and gesture recognition threshold.
